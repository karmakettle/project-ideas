Came up with this based on Alchemy API

description of different alchemy services. the news api looks interesting, too: http://www.alchemyapi.com/products/demo

Could also use the Semantria service. It’s probably really similar to alchemy api. it has a sentiment_polarity and sentiment_score. polarity is the general label of positive, negative, or neutral, and score is the exact # it came up with (-10 being most negative and 10 being most positive, takes some log to determine the value—maybe this means the lowest # returned is -1 and the highest is 1?). 10,000 free transactions…

I thought there was some service that could determine percentages of specific moods, though, not just positive/negative?
